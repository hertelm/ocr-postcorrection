# OCR postcorrection

## Resources

### errors.txt

A collection of isolated OCR errors from the cleaned ACL anthology reference corpus (https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~lahiri/acl_arc.html).

### ACL-benchmark

A benchmark with random paragraphs from the ACL corpus (downloaded from [Universit√§t Heidelberg](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/english/research/downloads/resource_pages/ACL_corrected/ACL_corrected.shtml), because it was not available through the [original source](https://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/)), with a manually corrected ground truth.
The benchmark is presented in our paper about Tokenization Repair (under review).
Here, it is filtered for OCR errors, excluding whitespace errors and hyphenation errors.
